To install this theme, simply upload the custom-theme folder to your WordPress themes directory, which is usually located at wp-content/themes/. Once you've uploaded the theme, you can activate it by going to the Appearance > Themes menu in your WordPress dashboard.

Customization
This theme includes several customizable options, including:

Custom logo and title upload
Post, Single and Search Page, Reply and Comment
